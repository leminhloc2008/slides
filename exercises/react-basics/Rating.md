# React Rating component

Implement a Rating component that displays a rating between 1 and 5 as a number of active and inactive stars.

It could be displayed using Unicode stars and could look like this:

```
★★★☆☆
```

The Rating component should have a property called _stars_ and an event called _onChange_. _Stars_ should be a number from 1 to 5. _OnChange_ should be triggered when the user clicks one of the stars. You can also style active and inactive stars differently (e.g. with the CSS colors _gold_ and _lightgrey_)
