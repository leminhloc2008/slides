# Trivia game

Create a trivia game that loads questions from this API endpoint:

<https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=1&category=9&difficulty=easy&type=multiple>

Implement three different "screens": _start_, _question_ and _result_

You can randomize the answers via a shuffling library, e.g. _array-shuffle_ on npm.

Some characters in API responses will be HTML-escaped; you can use a library to un-escape them, e.g. _html-entities_ on npm.
