# Todo list

Create a todo list application with the following functionality:

- displaying completed and incomplete todos
- toggling the completed state of a todo
- deleting a todo
- adding a new todo from a form
- displaying the total number of completed and incomplete todos

the application should be made of several components (e.g. _app_, _todo-list_, _todo-item_, _add-todo_, _stats_)
