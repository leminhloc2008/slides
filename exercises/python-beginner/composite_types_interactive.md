# Composite types - interactive

## Dictionary that describes a person

Inside an interactive Python console, start with an empty dictionary:

```py
person = {}
```

Step by step, add or modify data in the dictionary - the end result could look like this:

```py
{
    "first_name": "Kofi",
    "last_name": "Annan",
    "birth_year": 1938,
    "children": ["Ama", "Kojo"]
}
```

## Other tasks

Following the same process, create data structures that define the following:

- data of a country (number of inhabitants, capital, neighboring countries)
- a set of todos (that includes completed and incomplete todos)
- a set of transactions on a bank account
