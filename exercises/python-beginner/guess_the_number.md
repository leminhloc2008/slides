# Guess the number

Write a script that lets the user play a game of "guess the number". The interaction could look like this:

```
Take a guess: 56
Too low!
Take a guess: 78
Too high!
Take a guess: 66
Too high!
Take a guess: 60
Too low!
Take a guess: 63
Correct! The number was 63!
You took 5 guesses.
```
