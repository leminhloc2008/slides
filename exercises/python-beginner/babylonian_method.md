# Babylonian method

= method for computing the square root of a number which was already in use 4000 years ago in Mesopotamia

Process:

```
wanted: square root of 2

n = 2

Start with two approximations, e.g. a=1 and b=n

repeat the following until a and b are almost equal:
new a = average of old a and old b
new b = n / a

=> a and b will approach the square root
```
