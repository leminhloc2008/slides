# Leap year

Write a script that asks the user to input a year and tells them wheter that year is a leap year.

The rules for leap years are:

- in general, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 (e.g. 1904 was a leap year)
- exception from the above: if the year is also divisible by 100 it _is not_ a leap year (e.g. 1900 was _not_ a leap year)
- exception from the exception: if the year is also divisible by 400 it _is_ a leap year (e.g. 2000 _was_ a leap year)

Hint: "x is divisible by y" in Python: `x % y == 0`
