# Vocabulary trainer

Write an interactive program that lets the user train German-English translations.

When the user quits the program should display statistics about how many answers they got right.

You can use these entries for the vocabulary:

- apple - Apfel
- pear - Birne
- banana - Banane
- strawberry - Erdbeere
