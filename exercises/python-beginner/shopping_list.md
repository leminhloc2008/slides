# Shopping list

Write a script that asks the user for various items they want to add to their shopping list. In the end it should print all the items the user has entered.

Example:

```
enter an item or "x" to quit:
milk
enter an item or "x" to quit:
bread
enter an item or "x" to quit:
apples
enter an item or "x" to quit:
x
your shopping list is:
["milk", "bread", "apples"]
```
