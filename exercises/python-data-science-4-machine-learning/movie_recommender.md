# Movie Recommender

Based on data from the grouplens database, build a recommender that recommends users films based on films that they have liked

For this purpose, use pre-existing ratings of users and films. Simplify the data by using dimensionality reduction.

data sources (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/):

- MovieLens 25M Dataset (released 2019-12)
- MovieLens Latest Datasets
  - small (100K)
  - full (> 25M)
- MovieLens 100K Dataset (released 1998-04; messy CSV format, but continuous IDs)

example program run:

```py
mr = MovieRecommender()

mr.load_data()
mr.fit()
print(mr.accuracy_score())

print(
    mr.recommend_similar(
        [
            "North by Northwest (1959)",
            "Benny & Joon (1993)",
            "Last Man Standing (1996)",
            "Third Man, The (1949)",
            "Othello (1995)",
        ]
    )
)
```
