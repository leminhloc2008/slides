# URL shortener

topics: routing, template rendering, direct database connection via MongoDB

Create a url shortener service - similar to <bit.ly> or <cut.ly>

The home page should contain a form where the user can paste a URL. The URL shortener should store the URL together with an ID and redirect to it when an end user navigates to e.g. _myshortener.com/a4fn12_

Example hosted implementation: <https://markok-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/>
