# Authentication with React

Create an application whose contents are restricted to logged-in users.

Implement an `AuthProvider` context provider and an associated `useAuth` hook

## Demo auth service

You can use an auth service from [https://karuga-auth-service.glitch.me/](https://karuga-auth-service.glitch.me/) as a demo auth service.

It has two default users:

- username: alice, password: ecila
- username: bob, password: bob
