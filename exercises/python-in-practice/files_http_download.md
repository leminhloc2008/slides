# Download

Create a script that downloads Python package documentation pages.

As an example, the documentation for the _urllib_ package can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html.

You can use these topics:

```py
topics = ["os", "sys", "urllib", "pprint", "math", "time", "datetime"]
```

The downloads should be saved to a separate _downloads_ folder.

## Other tasks (optional)

Given a list of topics, download the Wikipedia articles matching these topics.
