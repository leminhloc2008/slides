# State management with actions and reducers

<!-- NOTE: other sections link to this section - take care when reordering -->

## State management

In more complex applications or components it makes sense to manage the state (model) separately from the view.

Often the entire application state is represented by a data model and every change to the state will be done by triggering a change to the data model.

## State management tools

- reducer hook (included in React, conceptually similar to Redux)
- Redux (based on reducers, commonly used with React)
- recoil (based on React hooks, released by facebook in 2020)
- MobX (commonly used with React)
- ngrx (used with Angular)
- vuex (used with vue)

## State management with actions

In the reducer hook, Redux, ngrx and vuex, each state change is triggered by an _action_, which is represented as a JavaScript object

<small>note: vuex uses the term _mutation_</small>

## State management with actions

In Redux / reducer hook:

- actions are represented by JavaScript objects
- actions always have a _type_ property
- actions commonly also have a _payload_ property

## State management with actions

example actions:

```json
{
  "type": "addTodo",
  "payload": "learn React"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "deleteTodo",
  "payload": 1
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "deleteCompletedTodos"
}
```

## State management with reducers

Technique that is used in _Redux_ and in React's _reducer hook_:

- a state transition happens through a reducer function
- the reducer function receives the current state and an action
- the reducer function returns the new state (without mutating the old state)

## Example: todos state management

Manual usage of a reducer:

```js
const state1 = [
  { id: 1, title: 'groceries', completed: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'taxes', completed: true },
];
const actionA = { type: 'addTodo', payload: 'gardening' };
const state2 = todosReducer(state1, actionA);
const actionB = { type: 'deleteTodo', payload: 1 };
const state3 = todosReducer(state2, actionB);
console.log(state3);
/* [{ id: 2, title: 'taxes', completed: true },
    { id: 3, title: 'gardening', completed: false },] */
```

## Example: todos state management

reducer implementation:

```js
const todosReducer = (oldState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'addTodo':
      return [
        ...oldState,
        {
          title: action.payload,
          completed: false,
          id: Math.max(0, ...oldState.map((t) => t.id)) + 1,
        },
      ];
    case 'deleteTodo':
      return oldState.filter(
        (todo) => todo.id !== action.payload
      );
    default:
      throw new Error('unknown action type');
  }
};
```

## Example: todos state management

usage with TypeScript:

```ts
type TodosState = Array<Todo>;

type TodosAction =
  | { type: 'addTodo'; payload: string }
  | { type: 'deleteTodo'; payload: number };

const todosReducer = (
  state: TodosState,
  action: TodosAction
): TodosState => {
  // ...
};
```

## Combining reducers

reducers can be easily combined / split to manage complex / nested state

state example:

```json
{
  "todoData": {
    "status": "loading",
    "todos": []
  },
  "uiData": {
    "newTitle": "re",
    "filterText": ""
  }
}
```

## Combining reducers

reducer implementation:

```js
const rootReducer = (rootState, action) => ({
  todoData: todoDataReducer(rootState.todoData, action),
  uiData: uiDataReducer(rootState.uiData, action),
});

const uiDataReducer = (uiData, action) => ({
  newTitle: newTitleReducer(uiData.newTitle, action),
  filterText: filterTextReducer(uiData.filterText, action),
});

const newTitleReducer = (newTitle, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'setNewTitle') {
    return action.payload;
  } else if (action.type === 'addTodo') {
    return '';
  } else {
    return newTitle;
  }
};
```

## Combining reducers

When combining reducers, a single reducer only manages part of the state; but every reducer receives any action and may react to it
