# Overview

## What is Vue?

one of the 3 big JavaScript UI frameworks (besides React, Angular)

## Basics of modern JavaScript UI frameworks

- state-based / declarative
- component-based

## State-basied / Declarative

- data model which describes the entire application state
- user interactions change the data model, causing the view to update automatically

## Component-based

- "custom" HTML tags
- data flow via props and events
- usually unidirectional data flow (from parent to child)

## Example: components and state in a todo app

<img src="assets/todo-components-state.svg" />

## Example: props and events in a todo app

<img src="assets/todo-components-state-props-events.svg" />

## Vue compared to other frameworks

- simpler than others
- _may_ be used without a build step

## History of Vue

- initial release in 2014
- 2020: Vue 3 (new composition API)
