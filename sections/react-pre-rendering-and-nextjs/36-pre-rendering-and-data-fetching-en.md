# Pre-rendering and data fetching

## Pre-rendering and data fetching

in next.js we can define code that is executed at several different points:

- code that runs when building
- code that runs on the server
- code that runs in the browser

## Pre-rendering and data fetching

when building, next.js will pre-render all entries in the `pages` directory

some pages are pre-rendered without any additional input, others might be connected to data sources

## Pre-rendering and data fetching

special (asynchronous) functions that we can export from a page definition file:

- `getServerSideProps` (runs every time a page is requested)
- `getStaticProps` (runs during build)

can load data and pass them into the page components as props

are only executed on the build machine or server respectively â†’ may read files or make direct database queries

The functionality of _fetch_ will be polyfilled automatically

## Pre-rendering

example: a page that loads a random joke from an API

```tsx
import type { GetServerSideProps, NextPage } from 'next';

type JokeProps = { joke: string };
const Joke: NextPage<JokeProps> = (props) => (
  <article>{props.joke}</article>
);
const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<JokeProps> = async () => {
  const url = 'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random';
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const joke = (await res.json()).value;
  return { props: { joke: joke } };
};

export default Joke;
export { getServerSideProps };
```

## Pre-rendering

exercises:

- pre-render a todo application with todos from <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos>
- pre-render a list of pokemon with data from <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon>
