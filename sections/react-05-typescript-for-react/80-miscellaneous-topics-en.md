# TypeScript: miscellaneous topics

## Build

browsers only understand JavaScript, not TypeScript

during build: TypeScript is translated to JavaScript, all type information is discarded

## Type declarations for libraries

some libraries include TypeScript declarations - e.g. _redux_.

other popular libraries mostly have type declaration packages that are prefixed with _@types_

e.g. for _react_: _@types/react_
