## Libraries

Python libraries for machine learning:

- _scikit-learn_
- _keras_
- _pytorch_

## Libraries

**scikit-learn**:

- supports many different classes of algorithms (including very basic neural networks)
- based on _NumPy_

**keras**:

- implements neural networks
- based on the _TensorFlow_ library
- can run on the GPU or TPU (tensor processing unit)

**pytorch**:

- implements neural networks
- low-level
