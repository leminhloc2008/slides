## Overview of methods

- **supervised learning**
  - **regression**
  - **classification**
- unsupervised learning
  - clustering
  - dimensionality reduction / compression
- reinforcement learning
  - optimization

## Regression

Assigning numeric values to numeric input data

examples:

- estimation of distance of galaxy based on its redshift
- prediction of stock price based on economic data

## Classification

Assigning labels to numeric input data

examples:

- classification as spam based occurences of words / phrases
- recognition of objects / persons / symbols in images
- diagnosis of illnesses based on symptoms / medical test data

## Clustering

Recognizing groups / clusters in input data

examples:

- recognizing reoccuring elements in computer vision

## Dimensionality reduction

mapping points in n-dimensional space to points in m-dimensional space (m << n, mapping is mostly reversible)

## Reinforcement learning

Optimization of strategies within a simulation

examples:

- simulating the progression of an illness, find the best treatment strategy
