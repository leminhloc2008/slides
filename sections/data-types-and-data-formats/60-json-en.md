# JSON

## JSON

JSON = _JavaScript Object Notation_: File format which is especially relevant in web development.

## Data types

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Array
- Object

## Null

The expression `null` symbolizes the absence of a value

```json
null
```

## String

Strings are delimited by double quotes

(In JavaScript single quotes would be allowed as well)

## Array

An _array_ contains a sequence of other objects

```json
["Anne", "Bob", "Chris"]
```

```json
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
```

## Object

An _object_ contains named entries

```json
{
  "firstName": "Thomas",
  "lastName": "Edison",
  "birthYear": 1847,
  "living": false
}
```

(In JavaScript the names of entries can be stated without quotes, e.g. `firstName`)
