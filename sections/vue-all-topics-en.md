# Goals

Vue is a frontend framework for web applications. It is simpler than the main alternatives Angular and React, but has just as much functionality. In a short time, Vue has become one of the most starred project on GitHub. Vue 3, released in 2020, features the new composition API, which brings ideas from React's hooks concept to Vue in a simple way.

In this training participants will learn the basics that are common to all frontend frameworks (like Vue or React), and the the specific features and mechanisms of Vue. At the end they are able to implement applications of various complexity with Vue while adhering to best practices.
